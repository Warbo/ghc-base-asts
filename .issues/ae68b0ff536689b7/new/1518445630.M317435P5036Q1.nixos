Subject: Output ASTs from base (at least)
Message-Id: <ae68b0ff536689b7-0-artemis@nixos>

We want the ASTs from the 'base' package, formatted nicely as JSON.

If we get *more* than this, e.g. all of GHC, then there's no point
filtering to just the base package; consumers can do that after if they
like.
